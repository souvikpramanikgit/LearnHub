 ## HTML Attributes

HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML element. They are specified using a name-value pair, where the name is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value.

For example, the `href` attribute of an `<a>` element specifies the URL of the linked page.

HTML attributes can be used to add functionality to an HTML element, such as linking to another page, or adding a tooltip to an element.
