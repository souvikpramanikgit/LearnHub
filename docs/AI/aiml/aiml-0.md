## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence is about creating systems that can simulate human intelligence.

## What is ML?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve over time. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on developing models and algorithms that let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. In simple words, ML teaches the systems to think and understand like humans by learning from the data.

## Applications

- Self-driving cars
- Chatbots
- Medical diagnostics
- Recommendation systems
