# Containers & Orchestration

Containers package applications and dependencies together, making them portable and consistent across different environments.

## What Are Containers?

- Lightweight, standalone, and executable packages.
- Encapsulate code, runtime, libraries, and configs.
- *Docker* is the most widely-used container runtime.

## Why Use Containers?

- **Consistency** between dev and prod environments
- Fast, scalable, and efficient deployments
- Isolation and security

## Orchestration with Kubernetes

As applications grow, managing many containers becomes challenging. Orchestration automates deployment, scaling, and management.

- **Kubernetes** is the leading orchestration platform.
- Coordinates containers across multiple machines.
- Handles load balancing, scaling, rollouts, health checks.

## Other Tools

- Docker Compose (development)
- Amazon ECS, Azure AKS, Google GKE (managed Kubernetes)

Containers and orchestration are vital for modern DevOps and microservices architectures!
