# Monitoring & Observability

Monitoring helps you track applications, infrastructure, and services for health, performance, and reliability.

## Monitoring vs. Observability

- **Monitoring:** Tracking metrics (CPU, memory, errors) and alerting for issues
- **Observability:** Understanding the internal state of systems by examining logs, metrics, and traces

## Why Is Monitoring Important?

- Detect issues early
- Ensure high availability and performance
- Provide insights for capacity planning and optimization

## Common Tools

- **Prometheus**: Metric collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **ELK/EFK Stack**: Log aggregation (Elasticsearch, Logstash/Fluentd, Kibana)
- **Datadog, New Relic, Splunk**: Commercial solutions

## Core Practices

- Set up baseline monitoring for all services
- Use dashboards and alerts for critical events
- Practice incident response and postmortems

A robust monitoring and observability setup helps teams respond quickly and deliver high-quality software!
